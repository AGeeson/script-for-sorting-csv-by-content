Most of the requirements have been captured, except which leads should be included if the leads callback date falls within the month.

Fairly happy with the way the code is organised. Could use a class for conditional statements, but their such small snippets I didn't think they would value from that level of complexity.

Unit tests have partial coverage. Would ideally have more tests for each function and a higher level test around the "main" function.

With more time would specify:
argument types in the functions
Add docstrings to the functions
Capture all requirements
